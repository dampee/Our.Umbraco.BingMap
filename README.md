Our.umbraco.BingMap
===================

Bing map is a quick and dirty replacement form the Umbraco Google Datatype.

Usage
-----
This is only for those who don't use the package.
1) copy the files from the UserControls folder.
2) Request a key at bingmapsportal.com
3) Create a data type and enter the requested key.

You are good to go.

The process was described on my blog: http://blog.dampee.be/post/2013/10/07/Bing-Maps-DataType-for-umbraco.aspx
